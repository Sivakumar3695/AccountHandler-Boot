# AccountHandler-Boot
A simple application with
1. Basic User Account handling
2. Custom Securtiy configuration written on top of Spring Security


# Basic User Account Handling
1. Facilitates easy sign in with Phone number and OTP option.
2. Onboards the users quickly without pesting them to provide details that they can update later.

 
# What to expect in the future?
1. More simplified sign-in options:
  a. Sign-in with Google
  b. Sign-in with Facebook
2. We are on path to couple this App as an Account Handler and User Session management in our multi-app microservice architecture. Hence, we will soon provide REST API options to show an user with the list of Application that he/she uses and the list of other applications that they can expore.
3. Our roadmap also includes to handle multiple sessions across devices for a single user. In such cases, we will allow the user to know those session details (like session info, devices, etc) and handle them all in one place (for instance, logout from a remote device).
